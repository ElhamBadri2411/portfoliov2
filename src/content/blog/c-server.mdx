## Introduction

I have always been interested in trying to figure out how things work. Abstraction is a core idea in computer science and software engineering,
but understanding what goes on behind that black box is really fun and can help you improve your skills as a software engineer. Having built websties in the past and wanting 
a deeper understanding of how the HTTP protocol works, I really wanted to  build my own HTTP server from scratch in C. My reasons for this were:

1. **Applying Network Programming Knowledge**: I wanted a way to refresh my socket programming skills and apply my theoretical understand of network programming concepts in a practical way.
2. **The C Programming Language**: I really like using C. The simplicity of the language, its speed, and the control you get make it really appealing. 
3. **Understanding how HTTP Servers Work**: Building my own server felt like the best way to understand how the HTTP protocol works.

Along the way, I applied  concepts other than network programming. I added very simple multi-threading, where a new thread gets created for each request and I implemented a hashtable. I used the hashtable 
to for managing routes and their handler functions. 

While the server is definately not production ready, I learned a lot making this project. There are tons of improvements that could be made (will be listed later on). My aim with this blog post is to 
share what I learned and potentially give anyone else that is looking to build their own server an idea of how I approached building mine.

## Key Concepts of HTTP

It is pretty important to understand **what** a HTTP server is before building it, so here is high level overview of some key concepts. I will specifically be talking about the HTTP/1.1 specification.

### Requests and Responses

Computers can communicate with each other in different ways. Some of those ways are

1. **Publish/Subscrbe (PubSub)**
    - where there is a central **publisher** machine and many **subscriber** machines
2. **Event-Driven**
    - where machines generate **events** and dont really care about responses
3. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**
    - where each machine is both a client and a server and machines communicate directly to one another

The way the HTTP protocol usually works is a client (your browser usually) will send a request to a server and wait for a response, then a server will send back a response.
There are things like request timeouts to make sure that the client doesnt wait for a response forever in case a server is down.

### HTTP request stucture

there are different parts of a HTTP request. Here is an example of one

```
POST /json HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.37.3
Accept: */*
Cache-Control: no-cache
Postman-Token: a17d7a00-ddb7-4eec-85c1-6eb0ae531a3a
Host: localhost:8080
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 75

{"id": 13221111,"hello": "heydeqweq","test": 213,"test2": "3dadasdfdaas21"}
```

The parts of this request are:
- **Method**: Indicates the action to be performed (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
- **Path**: The resource the client is interested in (/json).
- **HTTP** protocol: The version of HTTP the request is using (HTTP/1.1)
- **Headers**: Key-value pairs providing metadata (Content-Type, User-Agent, etc.).
- **Body** (Optional): Additional data, often used in POST requests to send form information.


### HTTP response stucture

similarly, responses also have a structure, an example of one is:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
```

The parts of this request are:
- **HTTP** protocol: The version of HTTP the request is using (HTTP/1.1)
- **Status** Code: a code indicating what happened with the request(200 OK, 404 NOT FOUND, 201 CREATED, etc.)
- **Headers**: Key-value pairs providing metadata (Content-Type, User-Agent, etc.).
- **Body** (Optional): Additional data, that the server will respond with


## Some Concepts we should Understand

### Sockets
Creating a C server means you have to use sockets to do network programming. A good overview for this is 
 [Beej's guide to network programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/pdf/bgnet_usl_c_1.pdf).

This guide is a really good guide on how networking works and give you a foundation for socket programming.

### Hashtable
To manage routes and route handlers, I used a hashtable. Hashtables (or Dictionaries, Hashmaps, JSON objects in other languages) are usually taken for granted, but in C we have to build it ourselves.

### Multi-threading
If we want our server to handle multiple requests at the same time, we need to add multi-threading. The way I implemented multi-threading in my server is definately not the best way to go about it. But its there and should be able to handle small loads.


## Building the HTTP Logic

Once we understand the basics, now we can start working on the actual HTTP server part.

#### Request Parsing
Data arrives from the socket in one big buffer, so we have to parse the request. This part isn't really too interesting, as it is just splitting the data into a bunch of tokens and storing/handling/validating them

I made a http_request struct to store the request data and a key_value_pair struct to help store the key values pairs:

```c
typedef struct key_value_pair {
  char *key;
  char *value;
} keyval;

typedef struct http_request {
  int verb;
  char *uri;
  keyval headers[MAX_HEADER_COUNT];
  int header_count;
  keyval params[MAX_PARAMS_COUNT];
  int param_count;
  int response_fd;
  keyval *body;
  int body_count;
} request;
```
this gets filled out in the parse_and_validate_request function I created, which again is just a bunch of strtok_r calls.
#### Routes
To handle routes we create a route table struct, which is a hashtable. The elements in this hashtable have will be called route entries and we create a 
request handler type for the actual request handlers later on. 

```c
typedef void (*request_handler)(request *req);

typedef struct route_entry {
  char *pattern;
  enum HTTP_VERBS verb;
  request_handler handler;
  struct route_entry *next;
} route_entry;

typedef struct route_hashtable {
  int size;
  route_entry **table;
} route_table;
```

We will be using a linked list collision resolution technique in case of collisions.

I use the following hash function, the key for each entry is the resource path.

```c
// djb2 hash algorithm
// http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html
unsigned long hash_rt(char *uri) {
  unsigned long hash = 5381;
  int c;

  while ((c = *uri++))
    hash = ((hash << 5) + hash) + c; /* hash * 33 + c */

  return hash;
}
```

We also need functions to create a route table and add routes to the route table.
Those aren't too interesting but if you want to see all those functions, it will be on my 
[github](https://github.com/ElhamBadri2411/HTTP-C-SERVER/blob/main/routes_handler.c).

Finally, we can setup the route table in the following function:

```c
route_table *setup_routes() {
  route_table *rt = create_route_table(20);
  add_route(rt, "/hello", get_hello, GET);
  add_route(rt, "/test", get_test, GET);
  add_route(rt, "/params", param_test, GET);
  add_route(rt, "/index.css", get_css, GET);
  add_route(rt, "/json", post_stuff, POST);
  add_route(rt, "/json", get_json, GET);
  add_route(rt, "/json", delete_test, DELETE);
  add_route(rt, "/json", put_json, PUT);

  return rt;
}
```


#### Response generation
For response generation, all we have to do is:
- send the response status line (HTTP/1.1 200 OK)
- send the content-type (Content-Type: application/json)
- send the Content-Length (Content-Length: 88)
- optionally send a body

once again this is simply just sending information through a socket

#### Multi-threading
I implemented multi-threading in a pretty naive way, for each new request I created a new thread and run the hande_request function. 
The issue with this is that there is no limit to how many threads can be created and it will crash the program if too many requests are made.
A better approach would be to create a thread pool and assign new requests to idle threads or even use select() and epoll() to allow a single thread to monitor 
multiple sockets.

## Lessons Learned & Future improvements

Building my own HTTP C server was a really good learning experiece. Altough I did come across many segfaults and double free errors, in the end it was a worth it.
I learned a lot about the HTTP spec. There's something pretty satisfying about seeing an HTML page get rendered when hitting your own server from scratch.

The server is far from production ready, there are probably some security vulnerablities and once again the thread management is pretty naive. But this was never meant to be a production ready server 
and was just for a learning experience. 

Some future improvements that I could add are:
- handling headers 
- improved synchronization
- security

If you are intruiged by the inner workings of the web, I highly encourage you to build a similar project. Buidling even a simple server really demystifies how everything works.
You can always start small and iterate!
