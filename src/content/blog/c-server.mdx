# Introduction

    Start with a personal anecdote on why you were interested in building your own HTTP server in C. (Example: curiosity about low-level web workings, a specific project you had in mind, etc.).
    Continue with the general explanations of HTTP servers and the suitability of C for this task.
    State the goals of your project clearly (what you wanted to achieve or learn).

# Key Concepts of HTTP

    Keep this section largely the same.

# Setting Up the Foundation in C

    Keep this section largely the same.

# Building the HTTP Logic

    Reflect on Challenges: As you outline the steps in this section, weave in personal examples of challenges you faced and how you overcame them. This makes the content more relatable and can highlight specific problem-solving approaches.

# A Simple C Server Example (Optional)

    Keep this the same if applicable.

# Lessons Learned

    Focus on Self-Discovery: Instead of just suggesting server expansions, make this section about the skills you developed, what you learned about networking/HTTP, and any changed perspectives.
    Relate to Your Goals: Did the project fulfill your initial reasons for undertaking it? Explain why or why not.

# Conclusion

    Briefly recap your journey and the key takeaways.
    Encourage experimentation and provide relevant learning resources.

Here's a possible snippet for the introduction:

"Building things from scratch has always fascinated me. When I started delving into web development, the way websites magically served content felt like a black box. That's when I decided to try and build my own HTTP server in C. I wanted to peek behind the curtain, understand how the web works at a fundamental level, and gain more control over how I might serve content in the future..."
